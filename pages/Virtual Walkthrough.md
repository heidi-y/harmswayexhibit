# Virtual Walkthrough for *In Harm's Way* 

Welcome to our virtual exhibit!

*In Harm's Way* seeks to address the question: "How will we survive the next Superstorm Sandy?" based on our traditional knowledge, our past experiences, and public policies. To help us answer this critical question we looked to bay house owners, firemen and baymen, coastal residents, first responders, architects and planners, and historians, who have extensive knowledge of past and recent storms. Through their eyes you will learn how our coasts have changed, the benefits and drawbacks of staying in harm's way or evacuating, and whether the latest approaches to storm management will stand the test of time. 

Through our viritual exhibit, we hope to continue a discussion on how we can adapt to more superstorms and hurricanes, or whether we need to consider alteratives to living in harm's way.

Long Island is not alone in facing these issues. Hurricanes Irene and Lee devastated dozens of communities in upstate New York, and coastal North Carolina has a long history of severe weather. They also face difficult decisions on where and how to live, whether they elevate homes or withdraw from flood prone communities. Across the United States we've seen whole villages and towns washed out on a regular basis. Let us learn from each other, so that together we can survive.
